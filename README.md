### You, Online!

An employer who is trying to evaluate you for their team needs to be able to get to know you online, fast! They may find you any number of ways. Maybe you tweeted at them, and they followed your Twitter profile link. Maybe you submitted your resume and they liked what they saw enough to do a google search.

Wherever they begin their journey, you want to create a clear path for them to continue getting to know you and ideally you want to have enough content to continue to keep them engaged.

For creating your website, you can use whatever tools you want - and use an existing template. You can find some of them here:
